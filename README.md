## üìù Contact Form Setup

The contact form is integrated with a webhook service (Make.com/Integromat) to handle form submissions. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root
   - Add your webhook URL from Make.com as `REACT_APP_CONTACT_FORM_WEBHOOK_URL`

2. **Webhook Configuration**:
   - The form sends a POST request to the configured webhook with the following JSON payload:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "User's name",
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "message": "User's message"
     }
     ```
   - The webhook should be configured to process this data and send it to your email or other destination

3. **Form Validation**:
   - Client-side validation for required fields and email format
   - Error messages are displayed below the relevant fields
   - Success/error notifications appear at the top of the form
